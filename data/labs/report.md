#Week #8 - Investigative Report
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

##Overview

There are a number of tools, emerging technologies and issues relevant to Linux system
administration, but out of the scope of our course.

I have identified 43 of them (one for each of you) to investigate and report
back to myself and the class on.

##Submission

This is an individual effort.

There is a rubric to guide you.

Submit your investigative report, in markdown format, to its dropbox
by Sunday Oct 29, 17:30.

##Report parameters

- Perspective: system administration using Linux (eg impact on, expectation of, ...)
- Format: markdown preferred, as these will be shared with the class
- Anonymity: indicate if you wish to be identified or not
- Published: in a new section in the course hub
- Completion time: 2-3 hours research & report prep

##Report Contents

**Ask for clarification if needed!**

- Explain/define the topic? 1-2 paras
- Who is behind it? corp, product, individual - 1-2 paras
- What do they hope to achieve? 1 para
- Where do they/it stand? 1 para
- How to use or play with the tech? 1-2 paras
- Further reading? unordered list, 3-6 links

The above adds up to 6-9 paragraphs, i.e. 1-1.5 printed pages

- Pic or two? if appropriate & relevant
- Perhaps sample code/commands? if relevant

##Process

In class on Oct 17th, I will have a bag or jar, with the report topics
on separate slips of paper. You will get to choose one.

Some of the topics have suggested sources or interpretaitons, in brackets after
the topic name.
