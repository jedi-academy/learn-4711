        <p>This short lesson introduces some project workflow concepts.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows" target="_blank">
                Atlassian</a> has some great tutorials,
            and I am using some of their images here.
        </p>
        <p>Github itself has some useful guide material, such as  
            <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/" target="_blank">
                forking projects</a>.

    <slide title="Centralized Workflow" layout="normal" tag="tag1">
        <div class="left">
            <p>With a centralized workflow, all the developers on a project
                share a central repository.</p>
            <p>They clone the repository locally, but they all publish
                changes to the shared repository.</p>
            <p>There is no locking or ownership, so this is problematic if someone else changes a file you are working on.</p>

    <slide title="Branching Workflow" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Following a branching workflow means that all feature development
                takes place in dedicated branches, other than "master".</p>
            <p>Once a feature is complete, its branch would then be merged
                into the "master" branch.</p>
            <p>Fixing an issue is considered a mini-feature, and would 
                be handled in its own (short-lived) branch.</p>
            <p>This is better than a centralized repository, but there can still be conflicts.</p>

    <slide title="Gitflow Workflow" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Gitflow workflow is a strict branching model convention.</p>
            <p>You have two main branches, "master" and "develop".
                The "master" branch is always release-ready, and is usually tagged
                with a release version number.</p>
            <p>All development is done on the "develop" branch, which is merged
                into the "master" branch to form a new release.
                If you only deploy from the "master" branch, conflicts don't affect it.</p>

    </slide>

    <slide title="Forking Workflow" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>With the forking workflow, there is a main repository,
                and each developer "forks" it to make their
                own server-side repository, which is then cloned locally.</p>
            <p>Developers push code changes to their own repository,
                and trigger a pull request when they are ready to merge
                their changes into the official repository.</p>
            <p>Only the maintainer of the official repository can update it.
                They may include updates that break your repo, but that is "your"
                problem.</p>

    <slide title="Gitflow Workflow Checklist" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <ol>
                <li>Fork a github project</li>

    <slide title="Isn't This Overkill?" layout="normal">
        <p>These workflows have evolved after much experience
            having multiple developers collaborate on software,
            in a distributed fashion.</p>
        <p>Most open source projects use the "gitflow workflow",
            although they may name their branches slightly differently.</p>
        <p>As a developer, you need to get familiar and comfortable with the
            workflow used for each of your projects, and you need to learn
            how to overcome common issues (like merge conflicts)
            in your environment.</p>
    </slide>
 
    <slide title="Gitflow Gotchas" layout="normal">
        <p>Gitflow is not the only workflow possible, and it is not
        without problems...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Merge conflicts - when two people update the same stuff</li>
            <li>Synchronization - when your project gets hopelessly out of
            synch with the team's</li>
            <li>Unhelpful commit messages - what/who broke something</li>
            <li>Unhelpful pull request descriptions - has something already been done</li>
            <li>Misusing issues - premature closing</li>
            <li>Properly attributing work done - not just for marks</li>
        </ul>
    </slide>
 
    <slide title="Gitflow Adoption" layout="normal">
        <p>This sounds terrible. Do any real-world projects use gitflow?</p>
        <p>Many do, though often with their own slant. 
            The following are from github alone, based on their branch naming.</p>
       <div class="left">
        <ul>
            <li>accord-net - master, development, then releases</li>
            <li>cakephp - master &amp; releases</li>
            <li>codeigniter - master, develop &amp; releases</li>
            <li>cygnite - master &amp; dev</li>
            <li>fuelphp - release masters</li>
            <li>kerisy - master &amp; releases</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
         <ul>
            <li>laravel - master &amp; releases (5.3, 5.4 etc)</li>
            <li>mpapierski - master &amp; develop</li>
            <li>phalcon - master &amp; releases</li>
            <li>signumsoftware - master &amp; releases</li>
            <li>symfony - master &amp; releases</li>
            <li>vaadin - master &amp; releases (7.7)</li>
            <li>yii - master &amp; release</li>
        </ul>
