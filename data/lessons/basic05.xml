    <slide title="1. WORKING WITH CODEIGNITER" layout="normal" tag="tag1">
        <p>So far, your webapp has been assembled using components appropriate 
            to your webapp's usecases. These include controllers,
            models and views, naturally. You have also used some helpers and 
            libraries, either built-in (such as the form validation library)
            or added from other sources (such as the formfields helper).</p>
        <p>In this lesson, we shall take a closer look at libraries and helpers,
            and at some of the other ways to build on the framework
            to make a better webapp.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Loading Components" layout="normal">
        <p>Building on CodeIgniter requires a good understanding of how it
            finds and loads components.</p>
        <p>When CodeIgniter loads components, it looks
            first in the appropriate subfolder inside your
            <code>application</code> folder, and then in the
            appropriate subfolder inside the framework's
            <code>system</code> folder.
        </p>
        <p>The CodeIgniter loader applies its own naming
            rules when looking for components, for instance
            looking only for the "ucfirst" filename
            corresponding to a library, or appending
            an appropriate extension ("_helper") when
            looking for a helper. You already know to watch
            out for this if developing on Windows and
            deploying on *nix!</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Loaded Components" layout="normal">
        <p>CodeIgniter maintains a list of unique loaded
            classes, regardless of where they came from.
            This means that you cannot have a controller
            and a model with the same class name, as the
            first to be loaded will be returned whenever
            you ask for either. This problem is addressed
            in PHP by using namespaces and/or fully qualified
            classnames, as in Java - that will not be properly
            exploited in CI until version 4.</p>
        <p>If a requested class is not in CI's loaded class list,
            it will attempt to locate it and instantiate one.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Finding Components" layout="normal">
        <p>In the case of O-O classes without inheritance, 
            CodeIgniter will check 
            inside <code>application/xxx</code> folder, and then in 
            <code>system/xxx</code>, where "xxx" is the kind of
            component you are loading.</p>
        <p>In the case of an O-O class which extends another
            class of yours, the superclass needs to be loaded first.</p>
        <p>In the case of an O-O class which extends one of CI's
            classes, CI will automatically look for the superclass
            in the <code>system/xxx</code> folder.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Extending Core CI Components" layout="normal">
        <p>CodeIgniter provides its own way to extend framework
            components. In the case of 
            <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/core_classes.html">"core" components</a>,
            your extensions go inside <code>application/core</code>,
            as you have seen with our base controller and base model.
        </p>
        <p>If you are replacing a core component with one of
            your own, it needs to be named with the "CI_" prefix.
            For example, <code>CI_Security</code> replaces the
            built-in "Security" component, automatically.
        </p>
        <p>If you are extending a core component, with over-riding
            methods, yours would use the "MY_" prefix and it would
            extend the built-in one with the "CI_" prefix.
            For example, <code>MY_Security</code> would extend
            <code>CI_Security</code>, and would be expected to
            over-ride one or more methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Do NOT modify source code inside the <code>system</code> folder!</strong>
        </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Extending Non-Core CI Components" layout="normal">
        <p>Non-core CodeIgniter components can be 
            <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/creating_libraries.html">extended similarly</a> to
            core components, except using the <code>application/libraries</code>
            folder.
        </p>
        <p>If you are replacing a CI component with one of
            your own, it needs to be named with the "CI_" prefix.
            For example, <code>CI_Pagination</code> replaces the
            built-in "Pagination" component, automatically.
        </p>
        <p>If you are extending a CI component, with over-riding
            methods, yours would use the "MY_" prefix and it would
            extend the built-in one with the "CI_" prefix.
            For example, <code>MY_Pagination</code> would extend
            <code>CI_Pagination</code>, and would be expected to
            over-ride one or more methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cool thing here is that you still refer to the CI component name.
            For example, <code>$this->load->library('pagination')</code>
            will automatically load <code>application/libraries/MY_Pagination</code>,
            <code>application/libraries/CI_Pagination</code>, or
            <code>system/libraries/CI_Pagination</code>, as appropriate :)
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Do NOT modify source code inside the <code>system</code> folder!</strong>

    <slide title="2. Working With Libraries" layout="normal" tag="tag2">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Libraries are files that contain class definitions - 
                usually one per file.</p>
            <p>Libraries can be explicitly loaded, as in
                <code>$this->load->library('whatever');</code>,
                or they can be autoloaded in <code>application/config/autoload.php</code>,
                for instance <code>$autoload['libraries'] = array('parser');</code>.
            </p>
            <p>Library functions are O-O.</p>
            <p>The image to the right shows the libraries built-in to CodeIgniter.
                Some of the names show in blue - those use app-configured drivers
                to do their thing using different tools, such as file or database
                persistence for sessions.</p>

            <i>Here is an <b>example</b> library, to help your understanding.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Plain HTML doesn't cut it in your views :(</p>
        <p>CSS frameworks improve presentation substantially :)</p>
        <p>But ... they involve CSS, Javascript &amp; often initialization</p>
        <p>
            <b>Caboose</b> is a library that manages these frameworks &amp; widgets</p>
        <p>For reference, you can find it inside a 
            <a href="https://github.com/jedi-academy/package-caboose">github repository</a> :)
        </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Frameworks &amp; Widgets" layout="normal">
        <p>In the context of presentation, a framework is a complete set of 
            CSS and/or Javascript files that provide styling and behaviour
            for your webpages. Examples include 
            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">BootStrap</a> or 
            <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>.</p>
        <p>These can be deployed from a content distribution network
            or as part of your webapp. If they are pervasive in your webapp,
            you would normally add links to them in your master template,
            so they are referenced on every page.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Caboose</b> solves the problem of managing the individual
            add-on components, referred to as "widgets",
            or frameworks that are only used on some of your pages.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Caboose Perspective" layout="normal">
        <p>What Caboose assumes to be a managed widget...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zero or more CSS files, to be included in your page's 
                <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
            </li>
            <li>Zero or more javascript files, to be included just before 
                <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
            </li>
            <li>An optional component template, holding a javascript 
                snippet needed to initialize the library/widget</li>
        </ul>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Caboose Assumptions" layout="normal">
        <p>Caboose assumes that you will store the bits and pieces for a
            component in specific subfolders, <code>assets/css</code> and 
            <code>assets/js</code> in your webapp's document root.</p>
        <p>It further assumes that you will tailor any needed
            widget initialization using a parser template inside your
            <code>view/components</code> folder.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Caboose Configuration" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Components recognized by Caboose are defined in its
                <code>$components</code> array, using names of your choice.
            </p>
            <p>Each component name references an array of settings for that component.</p>
            <p>
                The <code>css</code> and <code>js</code> settings can themselves contain an array of filenames
                to include, if appropriate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <p>Configuration for a sample datepicker component:</p>

    <slide title="Caboose Usage - Field Level" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Once the library is loaded, you basically tell it
                whenever you need to use a component...<br/>
                <code>$this-&gt;caboose-&gt;needed('whatever','fieldname');</code>
            </p>
            <p>"whatever" is the name of the widget, and "fieldname" is
                the ID of a component to be bound to that widget.</p>
            <p>The library will keep track of all of the widgets referenced,
                and generate/accumulate the needed Javascript initialization
                for each of them.</p>
        </div>

            <p>An example, inside a controller method that will result

    <slide title="Caboose Notes" layout="normal">
        <p>The Caboose library *is* a library, but there are
            some awkward things you might have noticed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configuration is done inside the class. Wouldn't it be 
                better to handle this inside a config file?
                That would make the library more generalized.</li>
            <li>The library relies on some view fragments in
                the <code>views</code> folder. This means we have
                several places in our webapp to change :(</li>
            <li>What if we wanted to store our assets somewhere 
                other than in <code>assets</code>? Shouldn't
                that be a variable, constant, or configuration item?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hmmmm - do you remember mention of something that would
            let us bundle related classes, configuration and views?</p>

            functions a and b come from your code, while function c comes from the built-in.

    <slide title="Formfields - a Sample CodeIgniter Helper" layout="normal" tag="tag3">
        <p>The <b>Formfields</b> helper is a collection of functions, 
            and corresponding view fragments, 
            to deal with the styling of HTML form fields.</p>
        <p>This helper was hinted at last week, and is actually
            part of the Caboose package.</p>
        <p>Each function builds a standard array of view parameters, and 
            then invokes the template parser to style the form field for 
            the CSS/JS framework(s) you are using.</p>
        <p>So what? This adds a layer of abstraction, so that
            you don't worry about form styling in your controller logic.
            Further, should you wish to switch CSS or Javascript 
            frameworks, all you have to do is update your set
            of view fragments :)</p>

    <slide title="Formfields Usage" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>How do we use a helper like this? In your controller,
                you could construct the HTML for a given textfield
                something like...</p>
            <code>
                $data['fuserid'] = makeTextField('Userid', "userid", <br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$member-&gt;userid,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Login ID for this member", 10, 10);            
            </code>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <p>To use the result in your view, it might look something like...</p>
            <code>
&lt;fieldset id="group3"&gt;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&lt;legend&gt;(b) Listing Details&lt;/legend&gt;<br/>
&#160;&#160;{fuserid}<br/>
&#160;&#160;{fbiz_email}<br/>

    <slide title="Formfields Helper - So What?" layout="normal">
        <p>Separated control logic from presentation</p>
        <p>Our views are *much* simpler, and do not have to involve PHP,
            Javascript, or customization!</p>
        <p>Change the view fragments to suit the framework(s) you want 
            to use (use the caboose, luke)</p>
        <p>Add function/view fragment pairs to suit your application</p>

    <slide title="4. Working With Packages" layout="normal" tag="tag4">
        <p>Packages are collections of related components organized 
            in a file hierarchy similarly to <code>application/</code>.</p>
        <p>Packages are not "loaded", in the conventional sense - their
            folders are added to the appropriate list of folders to search
            when the CI loader is invoked.
            Packages can be explicitly specified, as in</p>
        <code>$this->load->add_package_path(APPPATH.'third_party', '/some_package');</code>
        <p>or they can be autoloaded in <code>application/config/autoload.php</code>,
            for instance </p>

    <slide title="Package Folder Structure" layout="normal">
        <p>Packages contain most things that might be in an app, with one

    <slide title="Writing Packages" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>The components in a package are written and referenced "normally".
                They become "visible" when the package's path is added to
                the loader.</p>
            <p>Package paths are pre-pended to the list of folders to search,
                in the order that you add them, i.e. LIFO.</p>
            <p>"Normal" component loading rules apply inside a package too.</p>    
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <p>Packages are meant to be self-contained.</p>
            <p>Packages will often come from outside projects.</p>
            <p>Naming collisions are possible, and not properly dealt with -
                namespaces in a future CodeIgniter will fix that.</p>

    <slide title="Extending Built-In Packages?" layout="normal">
        <p>No packages are built-in to CodeIgniter.</p>
        <p>There are not a lot of good examples, at the moment.</p>
        <p>A suggested best practice is to "install" a package by
            creating a folder for it, inside <code>application/third_party</code>,
            and copying the packages files and subfolder structure there.</p>
        <p>Treat this notion of packages as CodeIgniter-specific.</p>
