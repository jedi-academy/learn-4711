    <slide title="1. CODEIGNITER MODELS" layout="normal" tag="tag3">
        <p>CodeIgniter leans more to the data access layer flavor of model,
            rather than the entity flavor of model.</p>
			<p>A "data access layer" model is understood to represent
			a collection of "entity" models.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/general/models.html" target="_blank">
                Models in CodeIgniter</a> are found in the <code>application/models</code>
            folder.</p>
        <p>The model class name should have the first letter capitalized,
            and the filename should match that. You can get away with breaking
            this rule on Windows, but your webapp will break on Linux
            (the model's source file will not be found).</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="CI_Model" layout="normal" tag="tag3">
        <p>Each model should extend <code>CI_Model</code>, or your base model
            if you use one.</p>
        <p>Models need to be loaded before use. This can be done explicitly,
            using <code>$this->load->model('customers');</code> or
            it can be implied by configuration in 
            <code>application/config/autoload.php</code>, with 
            <code>$autoload['model'] = array('customers',...);</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Once loaded, the model becomes a property of your
            controller, as in <code>$this->customers->...</code>.
        </p>
		<p>What <code>CI_Model</code> gives you, inside your model classes,
		is magic access to any of your controller properties
			as if they were properties of your model.
			Most notably, this includes the <code>db</code> property used to access
			the database driver.
		</p>

    <slide title="Implementing Models" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Some developers prefer to work closely with 
                <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/database/queries.html" target="_blank">
                    database
                    drivers</a>, writing their own SQL statements, as in<br/>
                <code>$results = $this->db->query(...);</code>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <p>Other developers prefer to use the 
                <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/database/query_builder.html" target="_blank">
                    Query Builder</a> for
                a more O-O approach to database manipulation, as in<br/>
                <code>$model->where(...);<br/>
                    $model->limit(...);<br/>
                    $results = $model->get();</code>
            </p>
        </div>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Using a Base Model" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Many developers use a base model (<code>application/core/MY_Model</code>)
                to provide a consistent implementation of the base model methods
                they want for their webapp. This typically includes all of the 
                CRUD methods, regardless of their style (driver or query builder).</p>
            <p>Your webapp models would then extend the base model, and implement
                usecase-specific methods.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <p>An example using a base model:</p>
            <code>
                class Sales extends MY_Model {<br/>
&#160;&#160;function __construct() {<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;parent::__construct();<br/>
&#160;&#160;}<br/>
                <br/>
&#160;&#160;function new_order(...) {}<br/>
&#160;&#160;function add_item(...) {}<br/>
&#160;&#160;function calc_tax(...) {}<br/>
&#160;&#160;function receipt(...) {}<br/>
                <br/>
                }
            </code>
        </div>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Misusing a Base Model?" layout="normal">
        <p>The CodeIgniter core classes can be extended by
            having a <code>MY_classname.php</code> inside 
            <code>application/core</code>. You might have noticed, with
            <code>application/core/MY_Controller.php</code>, that
            the class name inside that source file does not *have* to
            match the MY_... naming convention. We saw that with our
            original example, with the <code>Welcome</code> controller extending
            <code>Application</code>.
        </p>
        <p>CodeIgniter instantiates a singleton when a model
            or other core class is loaded, which makes it
            awkward to deal with interfaces or abstract classes. 
            However,  we can exploit
            the general treatment of included source files by
            having more than one thing inside one.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Here is a Fancy Base Model!" layout="normal">
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/jedi-academy/CodeIgniter3.1-starter3/blob/master/application/core/MY_Model.php" target="_blank">
                Here</a> is a "fancy" model. The source file includes
            a <code>Data_mapper</code> interface, as well as a
            <code>MY_Model</code> class.
            You could use this as a template for writing
            adapters for other kinds of models (folders, XML, etc).</p>
        <p>As long as one of your models, extending MY_Model, is loaded
            first, the <code>Data_mapper</code> interface will be
            accessible to you.</p>
        <p>You could add additional models to the file, for instance 
            <code>Xml_Model</code> or <code>Folder_Model</code>,
            each implementing <code>Data_mapper</code>. Note that
            this is not necessarily a "best" practice", just a 
            "possible" one, exploiting the current CodeIgniter.
            There will be better and more proper ways to do this
            with the next version!
        </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Example Working With DB Driver" layout="normal">
        <p>
            <code>$query = $this-&gt;db-&gt;query('SELECT name, title, email 
                FROM customers');</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>foreach ($query->result() as $row) {<br/>
                &#160;&#160;echo $row-&gt;title;<br/>
                &#160;&#160;echo $row-&gt;name;<br/>
                &#160;&#160;echo $row-&gt;email;<br/>
                }</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>echo 'Total Results: ' . $query-&gt;num_rows(); </code>
        </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Example Working With Query Builder" layout="normal">
        <p>
            <code>$query = $this-&gt;db-&gt;get();</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>foreach ($query-&gt;results() as $row) {<br/>
                &#160;&#160;echo $row-&gt;title;<br/>
                &#160;&#160;echo $row-&gt;name;<br/>
                &#160;&#160;echo $row-&gt;email;<br/>
                }</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>echo 'Total Results: ' . $query-&gt;count_all(); </code>
        </p>
		<p>The difference between this approach and working directly with
		the database driver: no SQL needed.</p>

    <slide title="2. OBJECT-RELATIONAL MAPPING" layout="normal" tag="tag5">
        <div class="left">
            <p>
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" 
                   target="_blank">Object-relational mapping</a> 
                is a programming technique or convention for converting
                data between an object model/state and a relational database 
                model/state.
            </p>
            <p>It is usually implemented by a tool or package which
				does one or more of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>From a database schema, generates an ERD, class diagram, and then code</li>
                <li>From a class diagram, generates code, an ERD and a schema</li>
                <li>From an ERD, generates a schema, and a class diagram and code</li>
            </ul>

            <img class="scale" width="550" height="375" src="/pix/lessons/4/4-8.png"/>
        </div>
    </slide>

    <slide title="ORMs, Really..." layout="normal">
        <p>In the PHP environment, object-relational mapping is typically
            effected by a third-party tool or plugin.</p>
        <p>These tools attempt to automatically create the robustness of JavaBeans
            with the persistence of Enterprise JavaBeans.</p>
        <p>These are notoriously awkward to implement properly.</p>
        <p>Several such packages are available for CodeIgniter:
            <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/" target="_blank">Doctrine</a>,
            <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/eloquent" target="_blank">Eloquent</a>, and
            <a href="http://propelorm.org/" target="_blank">Propel</a>.
            You're on your own using them, though - not part of this course!
        </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Objects From Results" layout="normal">
        <p>When PHP returns a result set from a relational
            database query, it usually does so as an
            iterable collection of row objects.
            Each row object has properties corresponding to the table
            column names that the data came from.</p>
        <p>If a row object is cast as an array, the result is an associative 
            array with the table column names as indices.</p>
        <p>Many developers consider the objects and/or associative 
            arrays returned by the database layer to be a simple form of ORM.
            CodeIgniter's perspective is that this suffices for most
            cases, and accordingly does not include or bundle a "proper" ORM.</p>
        <p>CodeIgniter does support a crude form of entity object
            support, where you can specify that the object resulting from
            a query be of a specific type. See the <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/results.html#custom-result-objects" target="_blkank">User Guide</a>
            for more details.

    <slide title="3. DATABASE UTILITIES" layout="normal" tag="tag6">
        <p>CodeIgniter has two classes specifically to manipulate databases.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/database/forge.html" 
                  target="_blank">Database Forge</a> class 
            helps you work with metadata.
            <ul>
                <li>Create or drop entire databases</li>
                <li>Create, drop or modify tables</li>
            </ul>                  
        </p>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/database/utilities.html" 
                  target="_blank">Database Utilities</a> class 
            helps you work with metadata.
            <ul>
                <li>List databases</li>
                <li>Backup or export databases</li>
                <li>Repair or optimize databases</li>
                <li>Extract or convert records (CSV, XML)</li>
            </ul>                  
        </p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Database Migrations" layout="normal">
        <p>Although not considered part of the core database components,
			CodeIgniter provides a <a href="" target="_blank">Migrations library</a>
			to make it easier to accommodate database changes
			across versions of your webapp.</p>
        <p>This is commonly used to alter table definitions or to add
			tables, with a new release of your app.              
        </p>
		<p>
			It is mentioned here for completeness, but is out of scope
			for our work.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="4. SUGGESTED MODEL CONVENTIONS" layout="normal" tag="tag7">
        <p>Use entity-related naming!</p>
        <p>Use the plural of an entity name for a table &amp; model name.
            An example would be the <code>Posts</code> model for
            the <code>posts</code> table.
        </p>
        <p>Use the singular of the entity name either for either a model or a 
            RESTful CRUD controller. Yes, this is confusing.
            The former practice is suggested by conventional entity modeling,
            while the latter is suggested by RESTful principles :-S
        </p>
        <p>Avoid controllers and models with the same class name. Only one will
            be loaded. Namespaces (coming in CI4) address this issue.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="5. DATABASE CONFIGURATION" layout="normal" tag="tag8">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Your database access is configured by settings in 
                <code>application/config/database.php</code>, or
                in environment-specific subfolders there for
                "development", "testing" or "production".</p>
            <p>Read the 
                <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/libraries/config.html" 
                   target="_blank">Config class</a>
                writeup carefully, as you want to use subfolders inside
                <code>application/config</code> to hold environment
                specific database configuration, for instance the
                username, password and database name to use when your
                webapp is deployed. <strong><code>git ignore</code></strong> any
                such subfolders, so you don't disclose confidential information.

        </div>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Database Conventions" layout="normal">
        <p>For our purposes, I will expect your database configuration 
            to work seemlessly when I pull your labs or
            assignments for marking. What this means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>application/config/database.php</code> should be unchanged</li>
            <li>
                <code>application/config/development/database.php</code> should
                hold your database configuration settings</li>
            <li>
                <code>application/config/development</code> is "git ignored"</li>
            <li>Each team member then uses their own database
                configuration</li>                    
            <li>I will add my <code>application/config/development</code>
                folder, with my settings, when I test your work</li>
        </ul>
    </slide>

    <slide title="&quot;Submission&quot; Conventions" layout="normal">
        <p>If you use a database in a project, clearly
            indicate so in your repo readme, and provide a SQL
            dump (gzipped) of your database, including dropping
            any tables you use before creating them, and
            including the insert statements to populate
            your database, for instance as the file 
            <code>setup.sql</code> or <code>setup.sql.gz</code>
            in the <code>data</code> folder in your project.</p> 
        <p>Do NOT include a CREATE DATABASE statement in your SQL!</p>
        <p>Do NOT make any assumptions about the database name
            that will be used when your webapp
            is run on another system!</p>
        <p>If your webapp breaks because it
            uses the wrong database, you may be fired.<br/>
            If you don't provide a database dump, and I 
            cannot run your webapp at all, you're definitely fired.
